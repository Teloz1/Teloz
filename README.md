# Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Numeric buttons (0-9)
- Basic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Clear button (C) to reset the display
- Evaluate expression using the "=" button
- Simple and responsive design

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the calculator, including buttons and display area.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the layout, buttons, and providing a clean, centered design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for appending values to the display, clearing the display, and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## How It Works
- When you click on any number or operator, it is appended to the display.
- The "C" button clears the display.
- The "=" button evaluates the mathematical expression entered in the display using JavaScript's `eval()` function.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in any web browser.
2. Click the buttons to perform calculations.
3. Press "C" to clear the display or "=" to calculate the result.
